1.Coffee Shop Line (Simple Queue):
Arrival: Customers arrive at the coffee shop and stand in line. Order Processing: The first customer in line gets their order taken, and the barista starts making the coffee.Serving: Once the first customer is served, they leave the queue, and the next customer in line moves forward to be served. Write a program to implement a simple queue


CODE
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


class shop {
    int size = 3;
    int token_shop[3];
    int r = -1; // rear
    int f = 0;  // front


public:
    void Enqueue(int t);
    int Dequeue();
    int isEmpty();
    int isFull();
};


int shop::isEmpty() {
    return (f > r);
}


int shop::isFull() {
    return (r == size - 1);
}


void shop::Enqueue(int t) {
    if (isFull()) {
        cout << "\nQueue is full. Cannot issue token.";
    } else {
        r++;
